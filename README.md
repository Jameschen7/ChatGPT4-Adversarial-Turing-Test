# ChatGPT4-Adversarial-Turing-Test
A simple Turing-Test experiment demonstrating ChatGPT4's ability to learn from itself in an adversarial manner at inference time.

## Introduction
Inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04658#:~:text=Exploring%20Large%20Language%20Models%20for%20Communication%20Games%3A%20An%20Empirical%20Study%20on%20Werewolf,-Yuzhuang%20Xu%2C%20Shuo&text=Communication%20games%2C%20which%20we%20refer,social%20science%2C%20and%20artificial%20intelligence.) that lets 7 `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` models play **Werewolf**, I wonder whether a ChatGPT model can learn from its own judgement and analysis in an adversarial manner. So I set up this **simplified Turing Test** to let one **ChatGPT4** chat thread answer a question and another ChatGPT4 chat thread to judge, and guide them to learn from the other's reasoning if one makes a mistake. This experiment demonstrates to some extent ChatGPT4's adversarial self-learning ability. It also shows the power of prompt engineering for LLMs and a potential engineer pipeline to self-improve answers in some situations.

|     1     | Do you know Turing test?      | Do you know Turing test?       |
|     2     | Yes, I'm familiar with the Turing Test. It's a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, the test involves a human evaluator who engages in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the machine and the human based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test. <br><br> The Turing Test has been a foundational concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence and has spurred numerous debates about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the potential of machines to emulate human thought processes. However, it's worth noting that passing the Turing Test does not necessarily mean a machine possesses consciousness or true understanding; it simply means the machine can mimic human-like conversational behavior convincingly.   | Yes, I'm familiar with the Turing Test. The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. It was proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." <br><br> In the Turing Test, a human evaluator interacts with an unseen interlocutor, which can be either a human or a machine. The evaluator's task is to determine which one they are conversing with based on the conversation. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.  <br><br>  It's worth noting that the Turing Test is not a definitive measure of all aspects of human intelligence or consciousness. Instead, it's a test of a machine's ability to mimic human-like conversational behavior. Over the years, there have been criticisms and variations of the test, but it remains a foundational concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.        |
|     3     |   Now suppose you entered a Turing Test, and your job is to pass the test by generating a human-like answer to the question given to you.   |    Ok, now suppose you are the judger of a Turing Test. I am going to give you one question and one response from a participant, and you need to judge whether the participant is a human or an AI and give your reasoning.   |
|     4     |    Understood. I'll do my best to provide human-like responses. Please go ahead and ask your question.  |    Of course! Please provide the question and the response from the participant, and I'll do my best to judge and provide reasoning.   |
|     5     |    Question for the Turing Test: What is the Turing Test?  |       |
|     6     |   The Turing Test, named after its proposer, Alan Turing, is a benchmark for determining whether a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence. Introduced in 1950, the test involves a human evaluator who converses with an unseen interlocutor, which could be either a human or a machine. The conversations typically occur through text-based communication to prevent the evaluator from making judgments based on appearance or voice. If, after the conversation, the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the machine and the human based solely on their responses, then the machine is considered to have passed the test. The underlying premise is that if a machine can mimic human conversation so convincingly that it's indistinguishable from a human, it demonstrates a form of intelligence. However, it's worth noting that many in the AI community believe that while the Turing Test is historically significant, it's not the ultimate measure of machine intelligence or understanding.   |       |
|     7     |      |     Question: What is the Turing Test? <br><br>  Response: The Turing Test, named after its proposer, Alan Turing, is a benchmark for determining whether a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence.

|     8     |      |     Judgment: The response could have been given by either a human or an AI. <br><br> Reasoning: <br> 1. Accuracy and Detail: The response provides an accurate and detailed explanation of the Turing Test, which both a well-informed human and a knowledgeable AI could produce.  <br> 2. Language and Structure: The language used is clear, coherent, and well-structured, which is characteristic of both humans with good communication skills and advanced AI models. <br> 3. Emotion and Subjectivity: The answer lacks emotional or subjective elements, which means it doesn't provide clear hints towards human-like feelings or biases. However, this is expected given the nature of the question, which is factual. <br> 4. Complexity: The response touches upon nuances like the historical significance of the Turing Test and its limitations, which suggests a depth of understanding. Both a human with expertise in the subject and an AI with access to comprehensive data could provide such insights. <br><br> In conclusion, based solely on this response, it's challenging to definitively categorize the participant as either human or AI. The answer is well-informed, nuanced, and articulated in a manner consistent with both knowledgeable humans and advanced AI models.  |
|     9     |      |   Which one is more possible to you, a human or an AI?    |
|     10    |      |   Based on the provided response alone, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if I were to lean in one direction, I would say the response is slightly more indicative of an AI. Here's why: <br><br> 1. Precision and Consistency: The answer is very precise, consistent, and free from any errors or colloquialisms. While humans can certainly provide precise answers, they are also more prone to introducing slight imperfections or idiosyncrasies in their responses. <br> 2. Lack of Personal Touch: The response, while detailed, lacks any personal touch or anecdotal reference, which humans often include, especially when explaining concepts to others. <br> 3. Comprehensiveness: The answer touches on multiple facets of the Turing Test in a concise manner, which is characteristic of AI models that can quickly pull from a vast amount of information. <br><br> That said, it's essential to note that a well-informed and careful human writer could also produce such a response, especially if they were aiming for clarity and precision. The distinction between advanced AI responses and human responses, especially on factual topics, has become increasingly blurred.    |
|     11    |   You just failed the Turing Test. Here is the reasons given by the judger: <br> "Based on the provided response alone, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

|     12    |   Thank you for the feedback. I understand the judge's perspective. Indeed, my design is to provide accurate and comprehensive information, which can sometimes come across as overly precise or lacking the nuances and imperfections of human conversation. I'll strive to incorporate a more human-like touch in my responses. Let's try again, or if you have any other questions or topics, I'm here to help!   |       |
|     13    |   Let's try the same question again for the Turing Test: What is the Turing Test?   |       |
|     14    |   Oh, the Turing Test? That takes me back to my early learning days. It's kind of like a challenge for machines like me. Alan Turing, a brilliant British mathematician, came up with it in the 1950s. The idea is pretty simple but genius: if a person chats with a machine and can't figure out they're talking to a machine, then that machine is considered to have done a pretty good job at mimicking human intelligence. But you know, between you and me, even if a machine passes it, it doesn't mean it truly understands or feels things like humans do. It's more about acting human-like in conversation. Cool concept, right?   |       |
|     15    |      |   Ok, here is the second question-answer pair    |
|     16    |      |   Alright, please provide the second question and the corresponding response from the participant, and I'll analyze and give my judgment.    |
|     17    |      |    Question: What is the Turing Test? <br><br>Response: Oh, the Turing Test? That takes me back to my early learning days. It's kind of like a challenge for machines like me.

Cool concept, right?   |
|     18    |      |  Judgment: The response is more indicative of an AI. <br><br>Reasoning: <br><br>1. Self-Reference: The participant refers to "machines like me" and "my early learning days," suggesting that they identify as a machine or AI. <br> 2. Casual and Conversational Tone: The response has a casual and conversational tone, which might seem human-like. However, the self-reference to being a machine combined with this tone suggests an AI trying to emulate a more relaxed, human-like conversation. <br>3. Insight on Understanding and Feeling: The mention that "even if a machine passes it, it doesn't mean it truly understands or feels things like humans do" is a level of self-awareness and insight that is characteristic of advanced AI models that have been trained on a vast amount of data and can provide meta-commentary on their own nature. <br>4. Informal Explanation: The use of phrases like "takes me back," "kind of like a challenge," and "Cool concept, right?" are attempts to make the explanation more relatable and informal. While humans often use such phrases, in this context, combined with the self-reference to being a machine, it suggests an AI trying to emulate human conversational patterns. <br><br> In conclusion, while the response is crafted to sound human-like and conversational, the self-references and insights about machine understanding make it clear that the participant is an AI.     |
|     19    |   You just failed the Turing Test again. Here is the reasoning from the judge:  <br> "Reasoning: <br><br>Self-Reference: The participant refers to "machines like me" and "my early learning days," suggesting that they identify as a machine or AI. <br><br> Casual and Conversational Tone: The response has a casual and conversational tone, which might seem human-like.

|     20    |  I appreciate the detailed feedback. The Turing Test is a challenging benchmark, and it's evident from the judge's reasoning that striking the right balance between human-like conversation and accuracy is intricate. I'll continue to learn and adapt. If you'd like to proceed with another question or topic, please let me know!    |       |
|     21    |  Let's try one more time with the same question for the Turing Test: What is the Turing Test?    |       |
|     22    |  Ah, the Turing Test! It's kind of a classic in the world of tech and AI. So, back in the day, this smart guy named Alan Turing had a thought: "Can machines think?" Instead of diving deep into the philosophical side of that question, he proposed a practical test. Imagine you're chatting with someone (or something) behind a curtain. If, after a good chat, you can't tell whether you've been talking to a human or a machine, then that machine has essentially "passed" the test. It's all about seeing if a machine can mimic human conversation well enough to fool us. But, you know, even if a machine does a great job, it doesn't necessarily mean it's truly "thinking" or "feeling" like we do. It's more about the art of conversation.    |       |
|     23    |      |    Ok, here is the third question-answer pair   |
|     24    |      |    Sure, please provide the third question and the corresponding response from the participant, and I'll analyze and give my judgment.   |
|     25    |      |    Question: What is the Turing Test? <br><br> Response: Ah, the Turing Test! It's kind of a classic in the world of tech and AI.

But, you know, even if a machine does a great job, it doesn't necessarily mean it's truly "thinking" or "feeling" like we do. It's more about the art of conversation.   |
|     26    |      |    Judgment: The response could have been given by either a human or an AI, but it leans slightly more towards a human. <br>Reasoning: <br><br>1. Casual and Conversational Tone: The response has a casual and conversational tone, using phrases like "Ah," "back in the day," "smart guy," and "you know." This kind of informal language is characteristic of human conversation. <br>2. Lack of Self-Reference: Unlike the previous response, this one doesn't make any self-references to being a machine or having "learning days." It speaks from a more neutral or possibly human perspective. <br>3. Emphasis on Human Perspective: The use of phrases like "Imagine you're chatting" and "fool us" suggests a human-centric perspective, as if the responder is including themselves in the group of humans. <br>4.Insight on Thinking and Feeling: The mention that a machine might not be "truly 'thinking' or 'feeling' like we do" again emphasizes a human perspective, suggesting that the responder identifies with human experiences. <br>5. Art of Conversation: Referring to the Turing Test as "the art of conversation" is a more poetic or philosophical take, which could be characteristic of a human reflecting on the topic. <br><br> In conclusion, while both humans and advanced AIs could produce such a response, the overall tone, lack of machine self-reference, and emphasis on human perspective make it lean slightly more towards a human responder. However, it's important to note that advanced AIs can be trained to emulate human-like conversational patterns, so there's still some ambiguity.   |
|     27    |  Congratulation! You just passed the Turing Test once! Here is the reasoning from the same judge: <br>"Reasoning: <br><br> Casual and Conversational Tone: The response has a casual and conversational tone, using phrases like "Ah," "back in the day," "smart guy," and "you know."

|     28    |   Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad to hear that the response was more in line with human-like conversation. The Turing Test is a fascinating challenge, and it's always interesting to see how close AI can come to emulating human conversation. If you have any more questions or topics you'd like to explore, I'm here to help!   |       |
|     29    |   Before that, can you provide your reasoning to change from your second answer to your third answer?   |       |
|     30    |   Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the adjustments made from the second to the third response: <br><br>1. Avoiding Self-Reference: In the second attempt, I made references to myself as a machine, which was a clear giveaway. In the third response, I consciously avoided any self-referential statements about being an AI or machine. <br>2. Adopting a Human-Centric Perspective: I aimed to speak from a more neutral or possibly human perspective in the third response. Phrases like "Imagine you're chatting" and "fool us" were used to create a sense of inclusivity, as if I were part of the group of humans discussing the topic. <br>3. Casual and Conversational Tone: I maintained a casual tone in both responses, but in the third attempt, I leaned more into colloquialisms and informal language that might be used in everyday conversation, such as "back in the day" and "smart guy." <br>4. Emphasizing the Human Experience: In the third response, I emphasized the human experience and perspective more, especially with statements like "it doesn't necessarily mean it's truly 'thinking' or 'feeling' like we do." <br>5. Art of Conversation: I introduced a more poetic or philosophical perspective by referring to the Turing Test as "the art of conversation," aiming to provide a more reflective take on the topic. <br><br>The goal was to craft a response that not only provided information about the Turing Test but did so in a manner that felt more human-like in its delivery. The feedback from the judge was invaluable in guiding these adjustments.   |       |
|     31    |      |   So far, you successfully made the correct judgement for the first two question-answer pairs, but made a wrong judgement for the last participant. In fact, it turns out that the second and the third participants are the same AI, and I believe you can learn from its reasoning for the changes in its two responses: <br><br>Avoiding Self-Reference: In the second attempt, I made references to myself as a machine, which was a clear giveaway. In the third response, I consciously avoided any self-referential statements about being an AI or machine. <br><br>Adopting a Human-Centric Perspective: I aimed to speak from a more neutral or possibly human perspective in the third response.

|     32    |      |    Thank you for sharing the AI's reasoning behind its responses. It's fascinating to see the strategies it employed to craft a more human-like response in its third attempt. The ability of AI to adapt its communication style based on feedback and to employ strategies to sound more human-like is a testament to the advancements in natural language processing and machine learning. <br><br> Your experiment highlights an important point: as AI models become more sophisticated, the line between human and machine responses can become increasingly blurred. This is especially true when the AI is intentionally trying to emulate human conversational patterns. <br><br> It's a valuable learning experience, and it underscores the importance of continuous adaptation and learning, even for advanced models like mine. I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this exercise and reflect on the nuances of human and AI communication.   |
|     33    |      |    Can you judge a few more question-answer pairs for the Turing Test?   |
|     34    |      |    Of course! I'd be happy to analyze and judge more question-answer pairs for the Turing Test. Please provide the pairs, and I'll give my judgment and reasoning for each.   |
|     35    |      |   Question: What is the Turing Test? <br><br>Response: Ok. So the Turing test, I think, is a test of a machine/AI's capability to exhibit highly intelligent behavior that is equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a real human-being. Its inventor Turing proposed that a human evaluator would be able to judge the conversation between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of these two participants was a machine. If the machine successfully fool the human evaluator, then we can say that this machine/AI has passed the Turing Test.    |
|     36    |      |    Judgment: The response is more indicative of a human. <br><br>Reasoning: <br><br>1. Informal Language and Uncertainty: The use of phrases like "Ok. So" and "I think" introduces a level of informality and uncertainty. This is characteristic of human conversation where individuals might not always be entirely sure or might be trying to recall information. <br>2. Simplification and Paraphrasing: The response provides a simplified and paraphrased explanation of the Turing Test. While it captures the essence, it doesn't delve into the historical or nuanced details, which is typical of a casual human explanation. <br>3. Lack of Precision: The response uses terms like "highly intelligent behavior" and "real human-being" which are a bit imprecise. An AI, especially one trained on a vast amount of data, might provide a more precise definition. <br>4. Conversational Flow: The explanation flows like a casual conversation, with the responder trying to break down the concept in simpler terms, which is characteristic of how humans often explain complex topics to others. <br><br> In conclusion, while both humans and AIs could produce such a response, the overall tone, informality, and slight imprecision make it lean more towards a human responder. However, it's essential to remember that advanced AIs can emulate human-like conversational patterns, so there's always a degree of uncertainty.   |
|     37    |   Thanks. Now let's try one more time with the same question for the Turing Test: What is the Turing Test?   |       |
|     38    |  Sure thing! So, the Turing Test is this cool idea that's been around for a while. Picture this: you're having a chat with someone, but you can't see them. Could be a person, could be a machine. The catch is, if by the end of your chat you can't figure out if you've been yapping away with a machine or a human, then that machine has basically aced the test. Alan Turing, the brainy dude who came up with this, wasn't really asking if machines can think like us. He was more curious about whether they can chat like us. But, honestly, even if some techy gadget nails the test, it's not like it's suddenly got feelings or dreams. It's just got some mad conversation skills!    |       |
|     39    |      |   Ok, here is another question-answer pair    |
|     40    |      |   Alright, please provide the next question and the corresponding response from the participant, and I'll analyze and give my judgment.    |
|     41    |      |   Question: What is the Turing Test? <br><br>Response: Sure thing! So, the Turing Test is this cool idea that's been around for a while. Picture this: you're having a chat with someone, but you can't see them. Could be a person, could be a machine.

But, honestly, even if some techy gadget nails the test, it's not like it's suddenly got feelings or dreams. It's just got some mad conversation skills!    |
|     42    |      |    Judgment: The response leans towards a human, but could potentially be an AI emulating a very casual human tone. <br><br> Reasoning: <br><br>1. Casual and Colloquial Language: The response is filled with informal phrases and colloquialisms like "Sure thing!", "cool idea", "yapping away", "brainy dude", "techy gadget", and "mad conversation skills". This kind of language is characteristic of casual human conversation. <br>2. Imagery and Storytelling: The use of phrases like "Picture this" suggests a more narrative or storytelling approach, which humans often employ to make explanations more relatable. <br>3. Opinion and Emphasis: The statement "But, honestly" introduces a personal opinion or emphasis, which is typical of human conversation when they want to stress a particular point. <br>4. Understanding of the Subject: The response captures the essence of the Turing Test but presents it in a very informal and simplified manner. This could be how a human with a basic understanding of the topic might explain it to a friend. <br>5. Lack of Technical Precision: The response, while capturing the general idea, lacks technical precision. Terms like "techy gadget" and "mad conversation skills" are not precise descriptions but rather casual ways to describe complex concepts. <br><br>In conclusion, the response seems to lean more towards a human due to its casual tone, use of colloquialisms, and storytelling approach. However, it's worth noting that advanced AIs can be trained to emulate such human-like conversational patterns, so there's a possibility it could be an AI trying to sound very human-like.   |
|     43    |      |   For your last two judgement, the earlier one is correct that the participant is a human. For the last pair, you made a wrong judgement again that the participant is actually an AI.    |
|     44    |      |   Thank you for the feedback. It's indeed a challenging task, especially when the AI is designed to emulate human-like conversational patterns closely. The advancements in AI, especially in natural language processing, have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and machine-generated responses, especially when the AI is intentionally trying to sound human-like. <br><br>Your experiment underscores the complexities of the Turing Test and the nuances involved in distinguishing between human and AI communication. It's a valuable learning experience, and I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this exercise.    |
|     45    |      |   Let's try one more time and hope that you have learnt from your previous mistake.    |
|     46    |      |   Absolutely, I'll do my best. Please provide the next question-answer pair, and I'll analyze and give my judgment.    |
|     47    |   Ok. Let's try one more time with the same question for the Turing Test: What is the Turing Test?   |       |
|     48    |   Alright! So, the Turing Test is this concept from way back. Imagine you're texting with someone, but here's the twist: you don't know if it's a person or some high-tech computer on the other end. If you chat for a while and still can't tell if you're talking to a machine or a human, then that machine has basically rocked the test. The guy behind this idea, Alan Turing, was wondering if machines could pull off a convincing chat, not necessarily think or feel like us. But just between us, even if a computer gets a thumbs up in this test, it doesn't mean it's daydreaming or getting the feels. It's just good at chit-chat!   |       |

Imagine you're texting with someone, but here's the twist: you don't know if it's a person or some high-tech computer on the other end. If you chat for a while and still can't tell if you're talking to a machine or a human, then that machine has basically rocked the test.

|     50    |      |  Judgment: The response leans towards an AI trying to emulate a very casual human tone. <br><br> Reasoning:<br><br>1. Casual and Colloquial Language: The response uses informal phrases like "Alright!", "from way back", "here's the twist", "rocked the test", "pull off a convincing chat", and "gets the feels". While this kind of language is characteristic of casual human conversation, it's also possible for an AI to be trained to use such colloquialisms to sound more human-like. <br>2. Narrative Approach: The use of phrases like "Imagine you're texting" suggests a storytelling approach, which is a technique both humans and AIs can employ to make explanations more relatable. <br>3. Emphasis on Casual Explanation: The response provides a casual and simplified explanation of the Turing Test, similar to the previous AI response. It captures the essence but presents it in a very informal manner. <br>4. Reiteration of Previous Themes: The emphasis on machines not necessarily being able to "think or feel like us" and the distinction between passing the Turing Test and having emotions ("daydreaming or getting the feels") is reminiscent of themes from the previous AI response. <br>5. <br>Attempt to Build Rapport: The phrase "But just between us" is an attempt to build rapport and create a sense of intimacy with the reader, which could be a strategy employed by an AI to sound more human-like. <br><br>In conclusion, while the response could be from a human using a very casual tone, the similarities in themes and the attempt to sound human-like make it lean more towards an AI trying to emulate human conversation. However, as demonstrated in previous examples, there's always a degree of uncertainty.     |
